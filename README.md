## Interactive Notebooks: 
1. [**_sampling_distribution_beta.jl_**](https://github.com/marcus-waldman/CCHS-Statistical-Analysis-Spr.-2023-/blob/main/sampling_distribution_beta.jl): An interactive (reactive) Pluto notebook to provide students with an intuitive understanding of the **central limit theorem**, with focus on (approximate) normality of **sampling distributions of sample means** even when data are *not* normally distributed. In this example, data are distributed according to a [beta distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution). Students investigate how the normal approximation of the sampling distribution is insensitive to skew/asymmetry, bimodality, etc. under sufficiently large samples.
